      <h3>Top of the Class 📚</h3>
      <p>
        Back in <strong>Grade 4 and 5</strong>, I was always in the <strong>Top 3</strong> in my class!  
        I worked really hard, stayed focused, and always tried to make my family proud.  
        It felt amazing to see my effort pay off every term — I learned that dedication truly matters.  
      </p>
      <p>
        When I moved to a new school, things changed a bit — but that didn’t stop me from trying my best!  
        I may not always be at the top, but I’m still proud of the person I’m becoming.

    <!-- 🏊 Swimming Journey -->
    <section class="achievement-block">
      <h3>My Swimming Story 🏊‍♀️</h3>
      <p>
        I started swimming when I was little and I was <strong>really fast</strong>!  
        I loved the feeling of being in the water — racing my friends, improving my time,  
        and hearing people cheer me on at the pool.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Swimming taught me discipline, strength, and how to never give up —  
        even when I was tired or nervous before a race.  
        But by <strong>mid Grade 5</strong>, I decided it was time to say goodbye to competitive swimming.  
        I still look back with pride, because that part of my life made me stronger and more confident.

    <!-- 🏑 Hockey Hobby -->
    <section class="achievement-block">
      <h3>Finding a New Passion — Hockey 🏑</h3>
      <p>
        After swimming, I discovered something new — <strong>hockey!</strong>  
        It quickly became one of my favorite things to do.  
        I love the teamwork, the energy, and how it keeps me active and motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though I didn’t make the <strong>first team</strong> this time, that’s totally okay.  
        I’m just getting started — and I’m determined to keep improving and having fun with it.  
        I know that in <strong>high school</strong>, I’ll have even more chances to grow and shine! 🌸
